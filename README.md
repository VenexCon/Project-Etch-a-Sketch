<h1> Etch-A-Sketch Project </h1> 

<p> This is my submisison for The Odin Projects Etch a Sketch task. This project took around 4-5 days to complete and involved many stressful nights! The website relies upon javaScript evenelt listeners to detail grid size and color. The grid is created dynamically by a for loop, with various functions to ocntrol properties and values. </p>

<p> This task helped cemet types of loops, arrow functions, array methods, dom nodelists & manipulation, along with javaScript & CSS interaction. The responsiveness was tested with MS Edge Dev tools but please do let me know of any issues. <p>
