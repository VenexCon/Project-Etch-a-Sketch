# Project-Etch-a-Sketch

<h2> Etch a Sketch time </h2>

This repo is for building an etch-a-sketch project that will contain a 16X16 grid of sqaures and be able to use RGBA and color selectors to create basic drawings and...well..sketches. 

Breifly breaking these down into smaller chunks, I can se that the below will be needed. 

<ol>
  <li>Visible 16 x 16 grid - I will use CSS:Grid for this </li> 
  <li>Using JS, i will need to colour the sqaures when the mouse button is clicked and held </li> 
  <li> the square colour will need to be using a value of color, and this will need to be selected by some sort of list or selector </li> 
  <li> an erase function to reset the sqaures back to white </li> 
  <li> I will need to have a reset button</li> 
  
  These are my intiial thoughts, no doubt these will break down even further again.
