<h1> Etch-A-Sketch Project </h1> 

<p> This is my submisison for The Odin Projects Etch-a-Sketch task. This project took around 4-5 days to complete and involved many stressful nights! The website relies upon javaScript event listeners to detail grid size and color. The grid is created dynamically by a for loop, with various functions to control properties and values. </p>

<h3> Snags and issues </h3> 
<p> This task proved to test my knowledge of DOM manipulation and the use of various inputs and how they would respond. My biggest issue with this task was definitely attaching event listeners to all grid-items. Although simple, it took me a while to figure out the best approach. I used google and MDN docs to reinforce the fundamentals, witch support from an asked StackOverflow question.</p>
<br>

<p> This project aided in not only using JS for HTML manipulation but also aided in how to use JS to manipulate CSS, which proved invaluable, especially for upcoming projects. </P>

<br>

<p> This task helped cemet types of loops, arrow functions, array methods, dom nodelists & manipulation, along with javaScript & CSS interaction. The responsiveness was tested with MS Edge Dev tools but please do let me know of any issues. <p>
